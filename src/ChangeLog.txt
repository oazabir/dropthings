Version 2.6.1
==============
FIX: Fixed the logic where widgets on a column is pushed down when an widget is dropped on a column.
FIX: Performance problem on DropthingsDataContext2 where in the constructor it tries to initialize all the Entity sets with MergeOption = NoTracking. It makes the ObjectContext to initialize all the entity sets and thus causing high CPU. Solved it by making Query<> function to execute the compiled queries using NoTracking. 
CHANGE: Create Facade and register in Container only once per request and reuse that same instance within the request. This reuses ObjectContext and all repository instances.

Version 2.6
===========
ADD: Both VS 2008 and VS 2010 Solution files.

ADD: Dropthings.Facade.Test which now has complete integration test to test facade operations. 
REMOVE: Linq to SQL based entities, Data Access Layer.

Version 2.5.6
=============
FIX: Fast RSS Widget was not saving the settings properly
FIX: Poor performance due to missing indexes and complex Linq to SQL queries resulting in no caching of critical data
ADD: DeveloperMode implementation. It will prevent script combining and CSS combining. But script defer still defers script loading.
CHANGE: Replace Unity container with Munq. Unity turned out to be CPU hoq.
CHANGE: All repositories now produce detached object in CRUD operations. All entities now have .Detach()

Version 2.5.5
=============
FIX: Twitter, Flickr widget was not loading Javascript from proper url when Dropthings runs on a virtual directory.

* FIX: Clicking on "Edit" load the state to initial state and does not allow changing anything on edit area.
* FIX: Resize problem fixed. You can now resize and widgets will persist their resized height.
* CHANGE: Disabled the widget resize functionality. It's not fully working now and not a feature that's widely in use. Hardly anyone (Google, Yahoo, Pageflakes, Netvibes) offers this.
* FIX: Maximize and minimize was buggy. Make some fixes. It's still buggy. 
* FIX: Manage Account page
* FIX: ManageWidgetPermission page.
